Hello! This is my games website using "Github pages"
I have not used this much, so dont be mad if there are bugs with my code or my games dont really work.
I am currently working on adding games and whatnot, so be patient.
I will include links to the games i have on this page
Yes i made the sites they do need to have different urls.
